            <small>Bardini</small> wrote about the development of the oN-Line System and the process and obstacles the team faced, but ultimately overcame. An <time>important</time> idea of the paper was the ambition to create technology that never existed before, and no one though possible. <strong>How does the impact of this creation make you feel about the present relationship between humans and technology? </strong>

             I <b>think</b> that there is this sort of <i>animosity</i> between humand and technology especially now that AI seems to be exploding. But also in a sort of parallel manner there is this lack of knowledge about the <code>machines</code> and computers people operate everyday. <button>So many levcels of abstraction that we really don't need to <span> think </span> about what processes are happening.   </button>
